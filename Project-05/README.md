# Project 5 - *Word Scramble*
https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/word-scramble-introduction

## Challenges

> 1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
> 2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
> 3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
