## Challenges

> 1. Go back to [project 1](https://github.com/solitaryewe/100-Days-of-SwiftUI-Updated/tree/main/Project-01) and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.
> 2. Go back to [project 2](https://github.com/solitaryewe/100-Days-of-SwiftUI-Updated/tree/main/Project-02) and replace the Image view used for flags with a new FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
> 3. Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.
